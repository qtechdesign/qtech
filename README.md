## Mission

The mission of the Frost Protection System (FPS) is to enable sustainable food and biosystem production through the integration of software and hardware solutions. FPS enables farmers to maximize their yields while minimizing costs by collecting system, time, and production data from various micro-locations and using smart analytics to improve production characteristics. With its focus on the user, continuous improvement, and technical innovation, FPS is uniquely positioned for rapid growth. 

We strive to foster development and create an innovative work environment through the implementation of new business process management systems. We also aim to adopt an agile scrum methodology throughout the entire life cycle of FPS. 

We are committed to continuously creating innovative technical solutions that improve our system. We also strive to use new technologies in a way that positively impacts our global climate.

## Vision

Our vision for the Frost Protection System (FPS) is to create an open source platform that enables efficient, sustainable and environmentally-friendly food production by leveraging innovative technologies. We strive to empower farmers, researchers, and consumers to make informed decisions about their food production and consumption by providing them with access to real-time data on weather conditions and frost protection systems. Through collaboration, we will continue to develop our platform and create a future where food production is both efficient and sustainable.

## Multisensor node

The Frost Protection System (FPS) Multisensor is a device designed to provide real-time data on weather conditions and frost protection systems. The device features an integrated solar regulator for 12V battery charging, and operates on 5V power. It can collect data from multiple sensors every 3 minutes, and can also be set to sleep mode between readings. The Multisensor is optimized to consume low amounts of power, making it suitable for use in low voltage devices (above 12V). With its user-friendly interface and easy setup, the FPS Multisensor is the perfect solution for monitoring weather conditions and improving yields.

## Communication device

The Frost Protection System (FPS) Communication Device is a secure and reliable gateway that enables the transmission of data between nodes and the cloud. It uses a private LoRa network to provide wireless communication over a radius of up to 10 km, depending on local radio equipment regulations. This device can be easily installed in any micro-location, and it allows farmers to maximize their yields while minimizing costs by collecting system, time, and production data from various micro-locations. With its focus on user experience, technical innovation, and continuous improvement, FPS Communication Device is uniquely positioned for rapid growth.

## Cloud device

The Frost Protection System (FPS) Cloud Device is a comprehensive microclimate solution for agricultural production. The device collects and stores data from various micro-locations, such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, and soil moisture, to provide farmers with real-time insights into their production environment. The device is powered by a secure cloud platform that is compliant with GDPR regulations and designed for optimal cyber security. Data is collected and transmitted securely using encrypted protocols to ensure that the data is not intercepted or tampered with during transmission. With its user-friendly interface and intuitive analytics, FPS Cloud Device allows farmers to make informed decisions about their crop production in order to maximize yields while minimizing costs.
