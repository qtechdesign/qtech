#Mission

The mission of the Frost Protection System (FPS) is to enable sustainable food and biosystem production through the integration of software and hardware solutions. FPS enables farmers to maximize their yields while minimizing costs by collecting system, time, and production data from various micro-locations and using smart analytics to improve production characteristics. With its focus on the user, continuous improvement, and technical innovation, FPS is uniquely positioned for rapid growth. 

We strive to foster development and create an innovative work environment through the implementation of new business process management systems. We also aim to adopt an agile scrum methodology throughout the entire life cycle of FPS. 

We are committed to continuously creating innovative technical solutions that improve our system. We also strive to use new technologies in a way that positively impacts our global climate.

#Vision

Our vision for the Frost Protection System (FPS) is to create an open source platform that enables efficient, sustainable and environmentally-friendly food production by leveraging innovative technologies. We strive to empower farmers, researchers, and consumers to make informed decisions about their food production and consumption by providing them with access to real-time data on weather conditions and frost protection systems. Through collaboration, we will continue to develop our platform and create a future where food production is both efficient and sustainable.
