## Mission

The mission of the Frost Protection System (FPS) is to enable sustainable food and biosystem production through the integration of software and hardware solutions. FPS enables farmers to maximize their yields while minimizing costs by collecting system, time, and production data from various micro-locations and using smart analytics to improve production characteristics. With its focus on the user, continuous improvement, and technical innovation, FPS is uniquely positioned for rapid growth. 

We strive to foster development and create an innovative work environment through the implementation of new business process management systems. We also aim to adopt an agile scrum methodology throughout the entire life cycle of FPS. 

We are committed to continuously creating innovative technical solutions that improve our system. We also strive to use new technologies in a way that positively impacts our global climate.

## Vision

Our vision for the Frost Protection System (FPS) is to create an open source platform that enables efficient, sustainable and environmentally-friendly food production by leveraging innovative technologies. We strive to empower farmers, researchers, and consumers to make informed decisions about their food production and consumption by providing them with access to real-time data on weather conditions and frost protection systems. Through collaboration, we will continue to develop our platform and create a future where food production is both efficient and sustainable.

## Motivation

In the past five years, climate change analysis and monitoring of the open-air food production cycle have revealed an increased occurrence of early spring frosts, which has a significant impact on crop yields. Frost events often result in complete yield losses for the upcoming season, which cannot be fully covered by crop insurance. Therefore, active measures to protect and reduce the risk of food production are necessary. One such protective measure is a frost protection system (through irrigation) based on the phenomenon of water anomaly, wherein energy is released when water changes from liquid to solid state. This energy is used to maintain flower and fruit temperatures between 0-2°C. During such protection of crops, an ice crust forms over flowers and fruits with temperature at 0°C that protects them through insulation effect. Modern frost protection systems employ technology to create air saturated with moisture (100% relative humidity) within the protected microclimate that results in significant savings in water requirements during protection since it eliminates evaporation and saves energy required for maintaining thin layer ice crystals at 0°C. Further advancement in technology requires dynamic operation model for the system with varying intensity of irrigation depending on current weather conditions. The reason behind this requirement is to maintain crystal structure of ice (transparent ice) under optimal water consumption throughout night for protecting fruits from negative external temperatures. Parameters that could affect crystal structure of ice are temperature, humidity, wind and intensity of irrigation with droplet size being considered as well. The main objective of this project is to analyze influence parameters on thickness and transparency of protective ice constructions. The obtained results would serve as basis for development advanced management system for frost protection as well as new types sprayers with variable intensity irrigation

## [PIP 2.0](https://qtech.hr/en/products/pip-pulsator-2-0)

PIP 2.0 sprayer kit is the best ratio of water energy consumption and rainfall efficiency on the protected surface of the frost protection system. The sprayer has a rainfall range of 5 meters at a pressure of 1 bar (water column 10 m). Uniform water flow in the range of 1-4 bar (water column 10--40m). Pulsating sprayer PIP 2.0 ensures a constant rainfall intensity in the range of 1.2-2.0 mm / m2 / h (depending on the installation microlocation and the design of the frost protection system, a grid on which pulsators are placed is defined).

## Fog

![fog](https://cdn.shopify.com/videos/c/o/v/baebd629095e49f58456fab5d803a2af.mp4)

Introducing hot air into the system can produce a fog, but it depends on the specific system and the conditions in which the hot air is introduced. In a frost protection system, the goal is to create a microclimate with 100% relative humidity to protect crops from frost damage. This is typically achieved by using irrigation to create a mist or fog that surrounds the crops and maintains the temperature above freezing. If hot air is introduced into the system, it can raise the temperature and reduce the relative humidity, which would make it less effective at protecting crops from frost. 

Introducing the underground hot air at 100% relative humidity (RH) and a temperature around 8°C into an orchard microclimate with -10°C and 95% RH would create a fog. The hot air would cause the temperature in the orchard to rise, and the high humidity would cause the air to reach 100% relative humidity. As the air temperature rises and the humidity increases, the difference between the air temperature and the dew point temperature will decrease, which will cause the air to cool to its dew point temperature. This cooling process will cause the water vapor in the air to condense into droplets, creating a fog.

The fog would help to protect the crops from frost damage by maintaining a higher temperature around the crops, and by creating a protective layer of ice on the crops. The fog would also help to maintain a high relative humidity, which would prevent water droplets from evaporating before they reach the crops.

However, it's important to note that the success of this method would depend on the specific system, weather conditions, and the type of crops you are protecting. It would be best to contact us to discuss possible system integration.
