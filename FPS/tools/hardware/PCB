Build (Altium Designer)
1) Open project
   - Main controller: WS_QTD_v4.0.PrjPcb
   - Power MPPT: WS_MPPT_Board.PrjPcb (v3.0)
2) Verify libraries are found (Library folder co-located with project).
3) Run DRC
   - Use WS_QTD_v4.0.OutJob or open Project Outputs/Design Rule Check reports (HTML/DRC) to confirm no errors.
4) Generate fabrication package
   - Use OutJob to produce Gerbers, NC Drill, assembly drawings, PDF schematics.
   - Outputs stored under Project Outputs for WS_QTD_v4.0/ (and WS_MPPT_Board/ respectively).
5) Optional: 3D review using mechanical STEP files under “3D model”.

Assembly notes (hardware)
- MCU: ATmega2560 family footprint; confirm oscillator and reset circuitry per schematic.
- Radio: E32-433T30S or E32-868T20S footprints present; maintain antenna keep‑out and RF ground stitching.
- Sensors: DS18B20 1‑Wire requires pull‑up; check Sensor_* schematics for exact value and placement.
- Power: MPPT board interfaces with controller via defined headers; verify polarity and ground returns.
- Relays/loads: Follow Relay.SchDoc for coil suppression and external connector pinout.
- Apply any pin remaps from NOTE_CHANGE_PIN.txt across harness and firmware.
